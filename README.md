# EPF-RUDN--Mars-test-
Mapping potential life nest on Mars, using ArcGIS and Arcpy 

This project developed for the Geospatial Programming class of Spring 2020, an international collaboration between two universities, EPF of France and RUDN of Russia
Find the website of EPF here : https://www.epf.fr/

I'm YANIS TOUDJI an aerospatial engineering student in the EPF french school of engineering. And I gave birth to this project in class taught by Sir DILEKLI Naci, from the RUDN university where I follow a double cursus. His help and assitance were really usefull to me, and he's a great teacher with a real sense of pedagogy. His github is the following: https://github.com/ndilekli/

The idea of this project is very simple: find potential life nest on Mars, based on three criterias that the user can input itself.

As we know it, life can grow and be sustained by three parameters: HEAT, WATER/HUMIDITY and MINERALS. So the idea here is to recover these data over the surface of Mars and to compile them to find the spots where the right conditions meet together to potentialy create life, we'll call these spots life nest. Unfortunatly the data for humidity and/or water weren't available, so won't appear in this study. but one can feel free to find them and add them to the code. 

You can browse into the "Presentation" file and open the "Assignment 30-04" in order to have a clear idea of what the project is about. 

On the following screenshot you can see what this is all about: 

PUT A SCREENSHOT


We have basically find some life nests and printed them on the surface of Mars so we can localize them. 

So this project might be usefull for searchers, future engineers or scientist looking for life on Mars or whoever wants an approach to find life on Mars. It's also great because it allows the users to put the parameters of its research. Let's say you track a bacteria which lives under  [-20°C;+30°C], you could parameter this range so the lifenest associated will be for this temeprature only !

All the datas came from the THEMIS mission, which the following website reported the datas: http://mars.asu.edu/data/

To get started with the project you'll need:
1- to have ArcGIS already installed in your computer
2- to download all the files in my repository in your computer, under a single file idealy named "MappingMars"
3- to open the JupiterNoteBook under the ArcGIS folder and run the notebook named "Find potential LIFENEST on Mars.ipynb"
4- run the fourth cell as it's the actuall command to run everything smoothly
5- copy and paste the root of the "MappingMars" folder in your machine onto the input that'll appear
6- carefully read the instructions that will appear, and select the range you want for your study
7- at the end, you could wether directly open the "normalygoodone" map (it will show directly the surface and your LIFENEST result); or  open ArcGIS, put the surface of Mars on it and then your LIFENEST result

If you need any help, infos, or anything else regarding this project or what is related to it you can contact me under my school mail adress:  yanis.toudji@epfedu.fr

This project was an idea, creation and completion of me TOUDJI Yanis, under the supervision of the teacher DILEKLI Naci.

Again, you'll have a complete presentation of the project and its creation on the "Assignment 30-04" under the "Presentation" folder.
